# Reinforcement Learning Project
This repository contains implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms for solving classic problems, such as **Taxi Simulation** using Q-Learning and **1D GridExplorer** using the SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) algorithm. These projects serve as an introduction to reinforcement learning, allowing agents to learn optimal strategies through interaction with the environment.

## Overview
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. This repository contains two RL implementations using Q-Learning and SARSA algorithms for different simulation tasks.

## Taxi Simulation (Q-Learning)
The **Taxi Simulation** task is a classic reinforcement learning problem where a taxi must navigate a grid to pick up and drop off passengers at specified locations as efficiently as possible. 

### Key Details
- **Environment**: A 5x5 grid with designated pickup and drop-off points.
- **Objective**: Minimize the number of steps needed to complete the task.
- **Algorithm**: Q-Learning, a value-based RL algorithm that updates Q-values based on the agentâ€™s actions, regardless of the policy being followed.

### Highlights
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Uses an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploring new actions and exploiting known rewards.
- **Learning Rate and Discount Factor**: Configurable parameters to control how the agent learns and values future rewards.

## 1D GridExplorer (SARSA)
The **1D GridExplorer** is a simple RL task where an agent navigates a one-dimensional grid to reach a target position. The SARSA algorithm is used, which updates Q-values based on the actions actually taken, following the current policy. This approach makes SARSA more "on-policy" than Q-Learning, as it incorporates the agent's exploration strategy.

### Key Details
- **Environment**: 1D grid with `target_position` at position 10.
- **Objective**: Reach the target position with minimal steps while exploring and exploiting possible actions.
- **Algorithm**: SARSA, which updates Q-values based on actions taken, aligning updates closely with the current policy.

### Parameters:
- `target_position`: The goal position in the grid.
- `num_episodes`: Number of episodes to run the simulation.
- `learning_rate`: Determines the impact of new information on the Q-values.
- `discount_factor`: Balances the importance of immediate and future rewards.
- `exploration_rate`: Controls the exploration-exploitation trade-off.
